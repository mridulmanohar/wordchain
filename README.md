# Word Chain Problem

Problem Statement: Create a Word Chain. Given two words of identical length as command-line arguments,
build a chain of words connecting the first to the second.
Each word in the chain must be in the dictionary and every step along the
chain changes exactly one letter from the previous word.
Optionally, accept a custom dictionary to lookup against.
For E.g.
$ wordChain coins money
... coins
... corns
... cores
... cones
... coney
... money
